<p class=subhead>twitter bots</p>

<br>

<p class="subsubsubhead">harvard stories</p>
<p class="project">a twitter bot that tries to make short stories out of the harvard sentences. <a href="https://twitter.com/harvard_stories">https://twitter.com/harvard_stories</a>
</p>
<p class="project">several years ago i was thinking a lot about randomness and narrative and took a deck of cards and wrote out a different sentence or phrase on each one with the idea that you could shuffle the deck, draw two or three cards, and it would read like a short story. a few years later when i first found out about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences">harvard sentences</a>, a series of <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/03/the-harvard-sentences-secretly-shaped-the-development-of-audio-tech/">phonetically-balanced sentences</a> originally developed in the 1940’s to test radio equipment and expanded upon through the 1960’s, i thought it would be a good set of sentences to randomly combine to form stories. this bot was made with <a href="http://www.brightspiral.com/">tracery</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/">cheap bots, done quick!</a>

<p class="subsubsubhead">this is my son</p>
<p class="project">a twitter bot that is constantly introducing its large adult son. <a href="https://twitter.com/this_is_my_son">https://twitter.com/this_is_my_son</a>
</p>
<p class="project">made shortly after reading jia tolentino’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-land-of-the-large-adult-son">the land of the large adult son</a>. i thought the idea of a very powerful person introducing their large adult son to a business acquaintance or whatever was a hilarious conceit and went really deep in tracery; this is by far the most complicated bot i’ve built. it’s made with <a href="http://www.brightspiral.com/">tracery</a> and hosted on <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/">cheap bots, done quick!</a>
