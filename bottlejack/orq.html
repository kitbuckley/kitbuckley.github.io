<p class=subhead>open review quarterly</p>


<p class="project">my friends <a href="https://ameliagreenhall.com/">Amelia</a>, <a href="https://adamgreenhall.com/">Adam</a>, and <a href="http://michaelahillen.com/">Michael</a> started the <a href="https://openreviewquarterly.com/">Open Review Quarterly</a>, an online literary journal with each issues focused on a certain theme. over a span of three years, i contributed seven pieces, a few of which were illustrated by some amazing printmakers whose work i had admired. my favorites are probably <a href="https://openreviewquarterly.com/interview#the-rhinestone-macbeth">the rhinestone macbeth</a> (which really should have been called "plan nine from rhea county") and <a href="https://openreviewquarterly.com/digital-presence#no-escape-starring-ray-liotta">no escape starring ray liotta</a>
