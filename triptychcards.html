<p class="subhead">triptych cards</p>
<p class="subsubhead">very short stories</p>

<p class="project">a set of playing cards, each with a different short, hand-written phrase. draw three at random to create a short story. an very early experiment in random story generators and what kind of inputs make for good outputs. full list of card titles <a href="triptych/triptychtext.txt">here</a>. my deck is down to fifty-one cards; somewhere along the way i lost "the tide was going out".
