i got you some tangerines
the house was on fire
i am so, incredibly, sorry
can you ever forgive me
i was playing basketball
asphodels and cigarettes
the snow will turn to ice
i prefer the old gods
maybe we're monsters
my car's still in the shop
waiting for your call
two for one tuesdays
i saw i missed your call
a postcard from maine
your unopened letter
how's your sister doing
unexpected confessions
everything costs $20
your uncle's farmhouse
your brother, the liar
i bring happy tidings
courageous restraint
our hero, with roses
the midwife was drunk
sometimes i miss you
pizza boxes everywhere
you were so cute then
coronas made of fireflies
your shoes were untied
you never apologized
everything we ever did
fingerprints in the dust
i left your bike unlocked
i love your new haircut
tomatoes from canada
vodka on the rocks
our initials in wet concrete
bishop takes queen
send her my regards
an unexpected turn for the worst
i have seen how it ends
the tide was going out
a mouthful of blood
the best orange i ever tasted
when do you get off work
you should really come visit
your dad was in the paper
contrails in a cowboy movie
better luck next time, perhaps
a litany of poor excuses
your friends should have warned you
what were we talking about
