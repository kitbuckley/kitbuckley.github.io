<p class="subsubhead">fishing tales</p>


<p class="project">a very real swordfish that i actually caught as a storm was rolling in while the coast guard was urging us to head back to port. i definitely didn't build this out of papier mache every night after work while watching all six seasons of justified (2010-2015). papier mache, googly eyes, 2017.
